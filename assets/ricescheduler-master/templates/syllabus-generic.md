# Rice Honor Code

In this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice
Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at
this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code
and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System
Handbook at <http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/>. This
handbook outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of
your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of
those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students
and faculty members throughout the process.

# Disability Support Services

If you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect
academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on
file with Disability Support Services (Allen Center, Room 111 /
<adarice@rice.edu> / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need;
and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.
