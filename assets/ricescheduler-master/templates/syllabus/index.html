<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all
courses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular
and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is
registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation
courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their
attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These
policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals,
early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences imposing grade
or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or
involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class and any other
policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and
professional classroom environment.</p>
<p>In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of
Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the studentâ€™s
instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a
planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding
any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or
incapacity, the student should contact the <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/law/students/">Office of Student
Life</a>.</p>
